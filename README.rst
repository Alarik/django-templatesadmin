PACKAGE MOVED TO NEW LOCATION
=============================

This package is now called "django-templatesadmin". Latest version is now
available on https://github.com/bartTC/django-templatesadmin/.

Sorry for all inconveniences this caused!

I will keep this package alive for some weeks and then delete it. Don't use
this, it will be outdated soon.

Templates Admin
===============

Templates Admin is a tiny, nifty application for your Django_ project to edit
your templates, that are stored on your disk, via an admin interface.

Originally this app was inspired by dbtemplates_.
